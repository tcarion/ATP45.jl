ATP45.jl provides a flexible API to run the NATO ATP-45 impact assessment model for CBRN-type incidents.

The results of the model implement the [GeoInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/GeoInterface.jl) interface so it can easily interoperate with other geospatial softwares.

## Installation:
The package is not registered, so you need to install it with:
```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/tcarion/ATP45.jl")
```
## Example:
The following snippet runs the detailed version of ATP-45 for a chemical incident with a persistent agent contained in a spray tank, with a wind of 2m/s:

```julia
using ATP45
using Plots
detailed_chem = (ChemicalAgent(), ChemicalWeapon(), Detailed(), ReleaseTypeB(), "SPR")
releases = ReleaseLocations([4., 50.], [4.15, 50.03])
wind = WindAzimuth(2., 45.)
result = run_atp(detailed_chem..., releases, wind)
plot(result)
```

## Documentation:
Please see the [Documentation](https://tcarion.github.io/ATP45.jl/dev/) for more detailed examples and description of the package features.

## Caveat:
Every ATP-45 have not been implemented yet. You might get an error if you try to run cases that are currently missing.
